# Flashcard-App
I built this app while learning the basics of JavaScript.

In this app, I use Express to build an flashcard app that can be used to review JavaScript concepts.
The frontend is built using Pug templates.

Getting started:
Install the following dependencies -> 
Express - npm install express --save
Body-parser - npm install body-parser --save   
Cookie parser - npm install cookie-parser --save   
Nodemon - npm install -g nodemon

To start the app, type 'nodemon' in the command line
To view the app, go to http://localhost:3000/

See a screenshot of the app below.
